## [1] Purpose

### User audience:
Fans of K/DA or people interested in finding more about K/DA.

### Intent:
Get more people to listen to their music and buy their merchandise, and also get more fans.

### Purpose:
Promote K/DA's music and merchandise, and also to get more people interested in their content.

### Who the website is catering for and value it provides for users:
K/DA fans, where they can access K/DA's content easily, and keep updated with their music.

### What is the website catering for?
The website is catering a centralized place to distribute and sell content from K/DA.

## [2] Design Process

This website is made to promote K/DA's content, and act as a centralized place to distribute and sell content from K/DA to fans or going-to-be fans.
Hence, the website needs to have easily accessible content like music videos, music and merchandise, as well as match the flashy style of the band's brand.

I wanted the design of the website to be user friendly, and have the content (music) to be easily accessible for the user, and so the first step was to have a nice and simple navigation bar. For the layout of the website, I made it so that each page had sections, spaced away from one another to clearly distinguish them, and I wanted the text to be easy to read, and so went with a white text and black background. The font I chose, BarlowCondensed, makes reading the text easy to read as well, and gives the website texts a clean look.

### User stories

* As a fan of K/DA, I want to find out where I can listen to their music, so that I can enjoy the music. From the navigation bar, I would need to click "Music", which will redirect me to the music page, where I can access K/DA's latest album, as well as all their songs. Each song has a link to spotify and youtube, which I can click to listen to their music straight away.

* As a person who does not know anything about K/DA, I want to find out what the band is about, so I can understand if I have interest in the type content they will be producing. I can click "About" from the navigation bar, which will redirect me to the about page, where I can learn what the band is, its members, its live performances and their social media. This will let me learn about K/DA and through their social media, I can learn even more about the content they produce.

* As a fan of K/DA, I want to buy their merchandise so that I can show my support for their music. From the navigtation bar, I would just need to click "Store", which will bring me to the store page with all the merchandise sold by K/DA. From there, I can click on the merchandise I am interested in buying, which will redirect me to the official shop where I can buy the item.

## [3] Features

### All pages
* All pages have a responsive navigation bar, with its position fixed at the top of the screen.
* All pages have a gif background of the main singer of K/DA, Ahri, which gives the website more dynamism and style.
* All pages are responsive.

### Home page (index.html)
The first thing a user would see on the home page would be the background gif of K/DA's lead singer, Ahri, along with a K/DA logo. This helps introduce the band to new viewers, or hype up existing fans of the band. Following up, there is a member section, introducing all members of K/DA, which icons are hoverable and clickable, which redirects the user to their individual descriptions in the About page (about.html) upon clicking. Following up, there is a music video section "Official music videos", which is the band's signature content, with 3 of their very popular music videos. Each music video has a title, description, and a youtube preview, which users can click and watch.

### About page (about.html)
The about page also starts off with a K/DA logo, with the background gif in view. But this time, below the logo is a brief description of the band, which gives more context of what the band is about to new users. Following up, there is a "Our members" section, where each member from K/DA has their own spot in the section where their name, icon, role and description is displayed. This gives detailed information on the members and allows users to understand or connect with the members more. Following up, there is a "Live performances" section, with youtube previews of K/DA's live performances, which users can click to watch. Following up, there is a "Gallery" section, with images of the band together, as well as individually. It is to show users how they look, which could make users like them more. Following up, there is a "Social Media" section, with 3 icons: Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. Clicking on the icons will redirect the user to the respective social media sites, where users can follow K/DA or view their posts.

### Music page (music.html)
The page starts off with a promotion section for K/DA's latest album, which has K/DA's best songs. Promoting the album at the start of the page makes users more likely to check it out and hopefully enjoy it. Following up with all of K/DA's songs, each song has its own link to Spotify or Youtube, where users can click the link to check the song out on the respective site, making access to K/DA's songs quick and easy.

### Store page (store.html)
The page contains K/DA merchandise with each item having a clickable image, which redirects users to K/DA's official merchandise page, where users can buy the merchandise to show support, earning more money for the band.
