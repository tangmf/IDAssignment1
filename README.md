## [2] Design Process

This website is made to promote K/DA's content, and act as a centralized place to distribute and sell content from K/DA to fans or going-to-be fans.
Hence, the website needs to have easily accessible content like music videos, music and merchandise, as well as match the flashy style of the band's brand.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
### User stories

As a fan of K/DA, I want to find out where I can listen to their music, so that I can enjoy the music.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

All pages have a gif background of the main singer of K/DA, Ahri, which gives the website more dynamism and style.
All pages are responsive.

### Home page (index.html)
The first thing a user would see on the home page would be the background gif of K/DA's lead singer, Ahri, along with a K/DA logo. This helps introduce the band to new viewers, or hype up existing fans of the band. Following up, there is a member section, introducing all members of K/DA, which icons are clickable, which redirects the user to their individual descriptions in the About page (about.html) upon clicking. Following up, there is a music video section "Official music videos", which is the band's signature content, with 3 of their very popular music videos. Each music video has a title, description, and a youtube preview, which users can click and watch.

### About page (about.html)
The about page also starts off with a K/DA logo, with the background gif in view. But this time, below the logo is a brief description of the band, which gives more context of what the band is about to new users. Following up, there is a "Our members" section, where each member from K/DA has their own spot in the section where their name, icon, role and description is displayed. This gives detailed information on the members and allows users to understand or connect with the members more. Following up, there is a "Live performances" section, with youtube previews of K/DA's live performances, which users can click to watch. Following up, there is a "Gallery" section, with images of the band together, as well as individually. It is to show users how they look, which could make users like them more. Following up, there is a "Social Media" section, with 3 icons: Instagram, Twitter and TikTok.

### Music page (music.html)
The page starts off with a promotion section for K/DA's latest album, which has K/DA's best songs. Promoting the album at the start of the page makes users more likely to check it out and hopefully enjoy it. Following up with all of K/DA's songs, each song has its own link to Spotify or Youtube, where users can click the link to check the song out on the respective site, making access to K/DA's songs quick and easy.
