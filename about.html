      <h1>About K/DA</h1>
      <img alt = "gallery-picture1" src = "Images/Gallery-pictures/gallerypic1.jpg">
      <p>K/DA is a virtual girl group consisting of four themed versions of League of Legends characters: Ahri, Akali, Evelynn and Kai'Sa.
      <br> <br>K/DA exploded into the music scene with their hit song “POP/STARS.” Fans of K/DA can’t get enough of their unconventional flair, from the trademark tails (which fans suspect are real) to otherworldly decor in their studio. “Our songs are for you to remember—-always be true to yourself,” says lead singer Ahri. K/DA hopes to take their music around the world in a global tour.</p>
